# Basic-Calculator


This project was made using javascript, html & CSS.

The Project essentially is a basic non responsive calculator website that uses the Bedmas order of operations with all the logic displayed in script.js.
The css contains basic styling of the calculator buttons and the display of the calculator, while the html contains all the elements of the calculator.
It is important to note that the calculator only accepts a max of 20 characters.
